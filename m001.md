## Tools  
Atlas
Compass
Shell

### Atlas
- Interface to manage mongo across clouds
- DaaS
- Setup && Manage db from the web
- ties or subscriptions

### Compass
- GUI to see data in db
- optimize query performance, manage indexes, etc.

### Shell
- JS interface
- connect to atlas
- query data
- import data into atlas cluster

### Downloading Shell on mac

- go to Mongo Download center
- select os
- open terminal
  - exec bash (_switch from zsh to bash_)
  - sudo nano /etc/paths
  - enter pw
  - go to the downloaded shell file (_prob in downloads_), copy the bin directory PATH, by right-click && select ```copy bin```
  - paste the bin path into etc/paths
    - note, no trailing spaces allowed!
  - to exit nano in the cmd, ctr + x
  - Y
  - TEST IF IT WORKED!
    - restart terminal
    - - **NOTE** have to go to security settings after trying next step and allow the app to run  
    - run ```mongo --nodb```

## Atlas
Dass
Handles replication  

Clusters:
  - groups of servers that store the data  
Replica set:
- a cluster where each server stores the same data
- redundant data copies  

Why Atlas:  
- simple setup, Atlas deploys + manages  clusters "for me"!  
- easy access to diff cloud proivders && regions  
- FREE access to experiment w. new toys!

## Connect to Mongo Using Compass
- download compass
- connect to the cours-eprovided data!!
  - copy && paste the string in the "new Connection" window...
  ```mongodb+srv://m001-student:m001-mongodb-basics@cluster0-jxeqq.mongodb.net/test```

## Connect to Atlas cluster the course is hosting
- OUTSIDE of a mongo shell
mongo "mongodb+srv://cluster0-jxeqq.mongodb.net/test" --username m001-student -password m001-mongodb-basics

NOTE
```The Atlas clusters we've looked at are replica sets. Replica sets are designed so that if the primary node goes down, one of the other nodes will step up to take its place so that clients can continue reading and writing data as if nothing had happened. The mongo shell is one such client.```

```
When connecting to an Atlas cluster using the shell, why do we provide the hostnames for all nodes when we launch mongo?
So that if the primary node goes down, the shell can connecto to other nodes in the cluster instead
```

## DBs, Collections && Docs
Databases serve as namesmaces for collections.  
Collections store individual records, documents.  
**Security Policies && User Roles** can be configured @ db && collection level. Not at document-level.  
**Accessing:** db.collection  
**Each DB && Collection COMBINATION** define a namespace.
